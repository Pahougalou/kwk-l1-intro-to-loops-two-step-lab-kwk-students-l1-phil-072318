# * Just below this variable, write a loop that does four things:
#   1. Increases the value of `steps` by 1
#   2. Outputs the value of `steps`
#   3. If the value of `steps` is divisible by 2 (remember how to use the `%`?),
# outputs 'Left', otherwise, it should output 'Right'
#   3. Sleeps for 0.5 seconds

  # Write a solution that uses the same code as how_many_steps?, but breaks the
  # loop if steps is equal to 6
